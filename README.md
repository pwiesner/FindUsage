FindUsage
=========

A basic sublimetext plugin designed to make it easier to search for class/method usage in ruby.

You can also bind the find usage command to a shortcut by adding the following to the user key bindings.

    {
        "keys": ["super+shift+u"],
        "command": "find_usage"
    }
